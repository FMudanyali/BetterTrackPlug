# Known Bugs/Issues
- Launching PSP games from Adrenaline directly causes issues, I recommend launching games from their bubbles instead.
- Using Adrenaline Bubbles Manager, having BubbleID set to PSPEMUXXX makes the app show the title as the games initial plus d, Md or Od for example.
- Homebrews don't show up.
- Dead or Alive 5 Plus once made the app crash. I don't know if the issue persists.

# To-Do
- Fix all the quirks, hopefully.
- Add customization back.
